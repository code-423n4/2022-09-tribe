Is this related to the upcoming merge? 
(expecting it to lower the fees, making gas optimization less significant)

It's because so much spam is going through those gas optimization reports and no one cares about it. I mean, i said it earlier, that people are so lazy even to parse the output from some automated tools.


[09/08/2022 10:56 PM] kryptoklob
It's also because these contracts are related to the shutdown of Fei/Tribe protocol - it's okay if things aren't super optimized as these contracts will be used once per user in most cases

I'm new here and was looking through old results and noticed the same. Do this low quality submissions receive payouts as well?

what does it mean for FEI to be backed by DAI?


[09/11/2022 4:48 PM] rvierdiiev
i guess that means that the amount of FEI that is in circulation is secured with the same amount of DAI that are controlled by protocol(it's backed as 1:1)


[09/11/2022 5:52 PM] cryptphi
thanks


[09/11/2022 8:57 PM] anonnp
How is `TribeRedeemer` going to be used exactly? I see `Intended to redeem TRIBE from the effective circulating supply in exchange for a pro rata portion of a list of ERC-20 tokens.` in the README, but I need more info, where do I find it


[09/11/2022 11:09 PM] kryptoklob
( @tomwaite @Eswak )


[09/11/2022 11:11 PM] joeysantoro
A number of ERC-20 tokens will be minted and transferred to the contract. Outstanding TRIBE would be able to transfer to the contract to claim the pro-rata portion of the basket of underlying. This would also effectively burn said TRIBE in a one-way redemption

[09/12/2022 11:14 AM] tomwaite
Also answered dms - feel free to send any more!


[09/12/2022 11:16 AM] tomwaite
Yep. The `SimeplFeiDAIPSM` will be loaded up with X DAI to match the X circulating FEI, which can be redeemed against the DAI


[09/12/2022 12:07 PM] Franfran#5067
So does `redeemBase` could be seen as a peg that decreases over redeem ?


[09/12/2022 12:26 PM] tomwaite
`redeemBase` will decrease over time with redeems yes. When a redeem happens and TRIBE is transferred into the contract, the `redeemBase` is decreased by the amount of TRIBE that was transferred in


[09/12/2022 2:58 PM] slightscan
If I make changes to 1 forge test only. For instance TribeRedeemer. Is it possible that forge doesn't compile the whole project? I'm only making changes to the test file.


[09/12/2022 4:04 PM] tomwaite
Forge should be smart enough to only recompile files that rely on the test afaik


[09/12/2022 4:38 PM] izhuer
a quick question about `RariMerkleRedeemer`. Just curious why the user needs to sign first? It seems that without signing, the rest functionalities can properly function. Or it is used for off-chain logic to collect some information like whether the user is willing to claim?


[09/12/2022 4:40 PM] kryptoklob
Signature acknowledges receipt of tokens etc


[09/12/2022 4:43 PM] izhuer
ic thx!


[09/12/2022 5:10 PM] izhuer
oh, wait. i am a bit confused further. since the code uses `msg.sender`, is the signature redundant since it serves the same functionality as EVM's native signature does? ...


[09/12/2022 5:11 PM] kryptoklob
Somewhat redundant. It's useful for offchain stuff.


[09/12/2022 5:11 PM] izhuer
that makes much sense! thx!
